**All related to SQL And DBMS **

Note : MySQL And SQL server is different

1.select query
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ; 

eg. select customerName , City from Customers ; 

2.select all columns
eg.SELECT * FROM Customers;

3.Selecting DISTINCT elements from columns
e.g SELECT DISTINCT country FROM Customers;

Counting DISTINCT countries 
e.g SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) from Customers;

4.WHERE  : filter rows based on specific condition
e.g SELECT * from Customers WHERE Country = "Mexico";
WHERE clause is not only used with SELECT but also with UPDATE , DELETE 

BETWEEN , LIKE , IN 

5.ORDER BY : used to sort the records
e.g SELECT * FROM Products 
ORDER BY Price ASC ; 

e.g SELECT * FROM Products 
ORDER BY Price DESC ; 

6. AND Clause is used to filter records based on two condition 
e.g SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE Country = "Mexico" AND CustId = 21;

7.OR

8.NOT : used for negative result
e.g SELECT * from Customers
WHERE NOT Country = "Mexico";

NOT LIKE
NOT BETWEEN
NOT IN
NOT Greater Than
NOT Les Than

9.INSERT INTO :

CREATE TABLE Customers(
    CustId VARCHAR PRIMARY_KEY,
    Firstname CAHR,
    Lastname CAHR
    )
INSERT INTO (CustId , Firstname , Lastname ) values(cust01 , "Aditya" , "Kauthkar");

10.NULL Values 
NULL value is no value 
Null value is the one which has been kept blank while inserting records;
IS NULL is used to test for empty values 

eg. SELECT CustomerName from Custmer 
WHERE Address IS NULL ; 

11.UPDATE : is used to modify the existing records 
eg. UPDATE Customers 
SET Custmoer_Name = "Aditya Kauthkar"
WHERE CustId = cust01;


12.DELETE : used to delete records
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName = "Aditya Kauthkar";

This will delete all records : DELETE FROM Customers;

13. Drop ; Used to delete whole table 
DROP table Custmer ; 

14. SELECT TOP : Used to specify the number of records to return 
e.g. SELECT TOP  3 * FROM Customers;

SELECT * FROM Customers 
LIMIT 3 ;

*** FOR oracle DB *** 
SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

Selecting top 50% of DB 
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

//SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Mexico";


15.SQL Aggregate Functions : Functions that perform operations on set of values and return a single value
MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column

Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT(*)).

MIN(): SELECT Min(salary) AS smallestSalary FROM Employee; 
Max(): SELECT Max(salary) AS largestSalary FROM Employee; 
Avg(): SELECT Avg(salary) AS avgSalary FROM Employee; 

//COUNT : can be used to know number of rows 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Custmer;        //null values are not counting

SELECT COUNT(CustId) FROM Custmers
where salary > 20000;

16.SUM :
SELECT SUM(Profit) FROM Customers;
