**All related to SQL And DBMS **

Note : MySQL And SQL server is different

1.select query
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ; 

eg. select customerName , City from Customers ; 

2.select all columns
eg.SELECT * FROM Customers;

3.Selecting DISTINCT elements from columns
e.g SELECT DISTINCT country FROM Customers;

Counting DISTINCT countries 
e.g SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) from Customers;

4.WHERE  : filter rows based on specific condition
e.g SELECT * from Customers WHERE Country = "Mexico";
WHERE clause is not only used with SELECT but also with UPDATE , DELETE 

BETWEEN , LIKE , IN 

5.ORDER BY : used to sort the records
e.g SELECT * FROM Products 
ORDER BY Price ASC ; 

e.g SELECT * FROM Products 
ORDER BY Price DESC ; 

6. AND Clause is used to filter records based on two condition 
e.g SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE Country = "Mexico" AND CustId = 21;

7.OR

8.NOT : used for negative result
e.g SELECT * from Customers
WHERE NOT Country = "Mexico";

NOT LIKE
NOT BETWEEN
NOT IN
NOT Greater Than
NOT Les Than

9.INSERT INTO :

CREATE TABLE Customers(
    CustId VARCHAR PRIMARY_KEY,
    Firstname CAHR,
    Lastname CAHR
    )
INSERT INTO (CustId , Firstname , Lastname ) values(cust01 , "Aditya" , "Kauthkar");

10.NULL Values 
NULL value is no value 
Null value is the one which has been kept blank while inserting records;
IS NULL is used to test for empty values 

eg. SELECT CustomerName from Custmer 
WHERE Address IS NULL ; 

11.UPDATE : is used to modify the existing records 
eg. UPDATE Customers 
SET Custmoer_Name = "Aditya Kauthkar"
WHERE CustId = cust01;


12.DELETE : used to delete records
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName = "Aditya Kauthkar";

This will delete all records : DELETE FROM Customers;

13. Drop ; Used to delete whole table 
DROP table Custmer ; 

14. SELECT TOP : Used to specify the number of records to return 
e.g. SELECT TOP  3 * FROM Customers;

SELECT * FROM Customers 
LIMIT 3 ;

*** FOR oracle DB *** 
SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

Selecting top 50% of DB 
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

//SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Mexico";


15.SQL Aggregate Functions : Functions that perform operations on set of values and return a single value
MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column

Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT(*)).

MIN(): SELECT Min(salary) AS smallestSalary FROM Employee; 
Max(): SELECT Max(salary) AS largestSalary FROM Employee; 
Avg(): SELECT Avg(salary) AS avgSalary FROM Employee; 

//COUNT : can be used to know number of rows 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Custmer;        //null values are not counting

SELECT COUNT(CustId) FROM Custmers
where salary > 20000;

16.SUM :
SELECT SUM(Profit) FROM Customers;

17.LIKE 
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';


18.IN 
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE Country IN ('Germany' , 'Mexico' , 'India' ); 


19.BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM Products 
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

SELECT * FROM Products 
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

SQL Join Clause:
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

1.INNER JOIN 
2.LEFT JOIN 
3.RIGHT JOIN 
4.FULL OUTER JOIN 

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table




20.Union 
Union  is used to combine result of tow SELECT Statement 
Union automatically removes duplicate data.
SELECT DISTINCT Values only

21.Union All
Combine two select Statement with duplicate valuesa as well 


22.GROUP BY 
 //Number of customers in each country
 SELECT COUNT(CustId) FROM Customers
 GROUP BY Country;

23.HAVING : Having clause is added to SQL because WHERE can not be used with Aggregate Functions
e.g.
SELECT COUNT(CustId), Country 
FORM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING  COUNT(CustId) > 10 ;

24.EXISTS: Used to test if the record exist in the subquery

**25.SELECT INTO (used for backup) **
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017
FROM Customers;

26.NULL Functions 


27.Stored Procedure 
Stored Procedure is nothing but a function which you can multiple times 

CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers
GO;

EXEC SelectAllCustomers;

28/SQL comment 
--SELECT all

//backup of SQL Database 
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak';


/***********************************************************************************/
CREATE DATABASE Customers; //ceeating DB
DROP DATABASE testDB //deleting DB
DROP TABLE Shippers; //Whole table will be deleted
TRUNCATE TABLE Shippers //all records will be deleted not table

ALTER: Used to modify the records
e.g ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD  reviwes vachar(255);

e.g ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN reviwes;
